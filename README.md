alkivi-api
========

alkivi-api is our python module used for scripts.
So far it can interact with :
- OVH API (api.ovh.com)
- Request Tracker (ticketing system)
- Databases using SqlAlchemy ORM

**Module architecture is still in beta, we are currently learning how to code in Python the right way ;)**

**This library is unofficial and consequently not maintained by OVH.**
